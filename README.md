# Analyzing-Flight-Delays-In-US-Airports


This project entails analyzing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on air travel in the US. 

The analysis is performed using two data sources: a dataset comprising flights from US airports and carriers from 2003 to 2022 (link: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ot_delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?20=E) and a list of large and medium hub airports (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_busiest_airports_in_the_United_States)
