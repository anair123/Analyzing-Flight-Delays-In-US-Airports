# Analyzing-Flight-Delays-In-US-Airports


This project entails analyzing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on air travel in the US. 

The project can be broken down into three parts:

1. Designing the database

The first step is to build a relational database after pulling data from using two sources: a dataset comprising flights from US airports and carriers from 2003 to 2022 (link: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ot_delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?20=E) and a list of large and medium hub airports (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_busiest_airports_in_the_United_States)

2. Extracting insights using SQL queries

The next step is to perform data analysis by writing SQL queries from the database. The main focus of the analysis is to determine how severe the impact of the pandemic has been in terms of number of flights, delays and cancellations. It analysis also delves into which factors (e.g, location, airport) may influence how bad the downturn in 2020 was and how successful the recovery from that downturn has been.

3. Building a dashboard
Finally, the project concludes with the building of a Tableau dashboard with the underlying data. It will help report insights uncovered in the previous section in a more digestible and visual appealing manner. 

Details regarding how the dashboard was built can be found in this Medium article: https://medium.com/@aashishnair/analyzing-the-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-flights-part-3-building-a-dashboard-with-tableau-47e636619748.
